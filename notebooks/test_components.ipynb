      "Kubernetes is a platform for creating, deploying, managing, and scaling application containers across one or more host clusters. It consists of a control plane and data plane, and nodes can run on regular compute instances or low cost spot instances. The control plane serves as the nerve center of each Kubernetes cluster and includes components that control the cluster, its state data, and configuration. Nodes are physical or virtual machines that can run pods as part of a Kubernetes cluster, and each node contains a kubelet responsible\n",
